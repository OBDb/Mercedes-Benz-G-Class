## Generations

The Mercedes G-Class (also known as G-Wagen or Gel√§ndewagen) has evolved through several generations while maintaining its iconic boxy design and off-road capabilities:

- **First Generation (1979-1990)**: The original G-Wagen was developed as a military vehicle with exceptional off-road capability. It featured a robust ladder frame, three fully locking differentials, and was available with various gasoline and diesel engines. Initially offered in short (2-door) and long (4-door) wheelbase versions with options for convertible, station wagon, and van body styles.

- **Second Generation (1990-2018)**: While retaining the same basic body structure, this generation saw continuous modernization over its nearly 30-year production run. Mercedes gradually added luxury features, more powerful engines (including AMG variants), and modern technology while maintaining the vehicle's off-road prowess. Major updates came in 1997 and 2007, with significant interior refinements and electronic driving aids.

- **Third Generation (2018-present)**: The first complete redesign since the vehicle's inception, featuring a wider body, independent front suspension, and a completely modernized interior. While maintaining its iconic appearance and off-road capabilities, this generation offers significantly improved on-road performance, advanced driver assistance systems, and luxury appointments comparable to the S-Class. Engine options include powerful V8s and the introduction of the electric EQG variant.
