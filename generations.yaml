generations:
  - name: "First Generation (W460)"
    start_year: 1979
    end_year: 1991
    description: "The original Mercedes-Benz G-Class was born from a collaborative agreement between Daimler-Benz and Steyr-Daimler-Puch in 1972, initially developed as a military vehicle at the suggestion of the Shah of Iran. Launched in 1979, the W460 featured austere and utilitarian design with angular, boxy styling that would become iconic. Built on a rugged body-on-frame construction with solid axles front and rear, it offered exceptional off-road capability through its three locking differentials - a rare feature that distinguished it from other passenger vehicles. The W460 was available in multiple body configurations including two-door and four-door versions, convertibles, panel vans, and pickup trucks, with both short (2,400mm) and long (2,850mm) wheelbase options. Engine choices ranged from economical diesels like the 240 GD and 300 GD to gasoline engines including the 230 G, 280 GE, and later fuel-injected variants. The interior was spartan and functional, focusing on durability over luxury. Major updates in 1981 introduced automatic transmission and air conditioning options, while 1982 brought fuel injection with the 230 GE. By 1986, over 50,000 units had been produced. A facelift in 1990 improved refinement, but the W460 remained fundamentally a working vehicle rather than a luxury SUV. Production ended in 1991 as it transitioned to the more refined W463 generation, establishing the G-Class foundation that would endure for decades."

  - name: "Second Generation (W461)"
    start_year: 1992
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The W461 generation served as the utilitarian workhorse continuation of the original G-Class philosophy, running parallel to the more luxurious W463 from 1992 to 2022. Built on essentially the same chassis as the W460 but incorporating powertrain improvements from the W463, the W461 was specifically designed for military, government agencies, and commercial users who needed the G-Class's legendary capability without luxury appointments. Featuring a 24-volt electrical system for military compatibility, the W461 retained the solid front and rear axles with three locking differentials that made the G-Class unparalleled in off-road situations. During the 1990s, it was powered by a 2.3-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine and 2.9-liter five-cylinder diesel engine. From 2001, it received modern turbodiesel engines including the 2.7-liter five-cylinder in the G 270 CDI Worker and later the 3.0-liter V6 turbodiesel in the G 280 CDI Worker. Limited civilian editions were occasionally offered, including the G 280 CDI EDITION.30 PUR in 2009 celebrating the G-Class's 30th anniversary, and the G 300 CDI Professional from 2010-2019, available in various body configurations from panel vans to pickup trucks. These featured more basic interiors with vinyl surfaces, rubber floor coverings, and manually operated controls, emphasizing function over form. The W461 proved so successful in military applications that it was used by armed forces worldwide, earning nicknames like 'Wolf' in German service. Production finally ended in 2022 when it was replaced by the new W464 military variant."

  - name: "Third Generation (W463, First Generation)"
    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The first-generation W463 marked the G-Class's transformation from purely utilitarian vehicle to luxury SUV, running for an remarkable 28 years from 1990 to 2018. This generation moved the G-Class upmarket to compete with vehicles like the Range Rover, featuring significantly improved interior appointments with wood trim, leather upholstery, and more sophisticated amenities while retaining the iconic boxy exterior design. The W463 introduced full-time four-wheel drive with electrically locking differentials and ABS as standard equipment. Initially offering familiar engines from the W460, the range expanded dramatically over its long production run to include everything from four-cylinder to twelve-cylinder engines, naturally aspirated to supercharged and twin-turbo configurations. Key updates included the 1997 revision with V6 engines replacing inline units, the 2002 U.S. market launch, and the 2007 major refresh with new interior, HID headlamps, and updated technology. The W463 spawned numerous special editions and variants, including the legendary 500 GE V8 (1993), G 500 Classic Special-Edition (1999), and exotic models like the G 63 AMG 6×6 (2013-2015) and Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet (2017). AMG variants became increasingly important, starting with the G 55 AMG in 2002 and evolving through supercharged and twin-turbo V8 and V12 engines producing up to 621 horsepower. By the end of production, the first-generation W463 offered the highest number of paint color options (22) of any Mercedes-Benz model and had established the G-Class as a status symbol beloved by celebrities and luxury SUV enthusiasts worldwide."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (W463, Second Generation)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: 2024
    description: "The second-generation W463 represented the most comprehensive redesign in G-Class history while maintaining the iconic visual DNA that made it instantly recognizable. Launched in January 2018, this generation grew significantly in dimensions - 121mm wider, 53mm longer, with 6mm more ground clearance - primarily to meet new EU pedestrian safety regulations while improving interior space and driving dynamics. Despite retaining the W463 chassis designation, only three parts carried over from the previous generation: headlamp washers, door handles, and spare wheel cover. The most significant mechanical change was switching from a recirculating ball steering system to variable-ratio rack-and-pinion with electric power assistance, necessitating a move from solid front axle to independent front suspension while maintaining the solid rear axle and three locking differentials. This enabled modern safety features like active lane-keeping assist and collision avoidance systems. Interior technology leaped forward with dual 12-inch displays, smartphone integration, and 64-color ambient lighting, while build quality reached new heights with tighter panel gaps and improved materials. The initial lineup included the G 500/G 550 with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 producing 416 horsepower and the Mercedes-AMG G 63 with 577 horsepower. Diesel variants followed with the G 350 d and G 400 d using clean 2.9-liter inline-six engines. Special editions included the Stronger Than Time anniversary models and the exclusive G manufaktur customization program. Notable variants included the return of the G 63 4×4² in 2022 and the Final Edition G 500 V8 in 2023, marking the end of V8 power in the non-AMG model. This generation successfully modernized the G-Class for contemporary luxury SUV buyers while preserving its uncompromising off-road capability."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (W465)"
    start_year: 2024
    end_year: null
    description: "The W465 generation, introduced in March 2024, represents the latest evolution of the G-Class with a focus on electrification, efficiency, and advanced technology while maintaining the model's legendary off-road prowess. This generation marks a significant powertrain transition, replacing the previous G 500's 4.0-liter V8 with a new 3.0-liter inline-six turbocharged engine featuring 48-volt mild-hybrid technology, producing 443 horsepower and enhanced efficiency. The Mercedes-AMG G 63 continues with the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, now also featuring mild-hybrid assistance. The diesel option evolves to the G 450 d with an upgraded 3.0-liter inline-six turbodiesel producing 362 horsepower, also with 48-volt hybrid support. Most significantly, April 2024 saw the introduction of the G 580 with EQ Technology, the first fully electric G-Class featuring four independent electric motors producing 579 horsepower and 859 lb-ft of torque, capable of 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds. The electric variant maintains true off-road capability with the signature three locking differentials through innovative engineering, though it faces challenges with its 6,801-pound weight, limited 239-mile EPA range, and high price point compared to ICE variants. All W465 models feature updated exterior styling with improved aerodynamics inspired by the Concept EQG, enhanced interior technology, and continued availability of the G manufaktur customization program. The generation represents Mercedes-Benz's commitment to preserving G-Class heritage while advancing toward an electrified future, though early sales figures suggest consumer preference still favors traditional powertrains over the electric variant."
